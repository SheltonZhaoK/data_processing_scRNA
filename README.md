# Workflows for data processing of the single cell scRNA-seq data
This work reproduced the the single cell scRNA-seq data preprocessing and clustering workflows for 3k PBMCs dataset in <a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html">Seurat</a> and <a href="https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html">Scanpy</a>. The data consist of 3k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor and are freely available from 10x Genomics. The workflow is implemented in R and Python.<br><br>
